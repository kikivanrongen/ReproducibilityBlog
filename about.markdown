This is a blog for the Reinforcement Learning course of the University of Amsterdam. It is based on the third lab assignment, where we are asked to perform a small research on one of the provided topics. We have chosen to investigate the following matter:

> Semi-gradient methods do not always converge. DQN uses a semi- gradient version of Q-learning. Can you find an environment
> where this method diverges? How much do the tricks in DQN (e.g. experience replay, target network) help to avoid divergence?
